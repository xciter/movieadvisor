Movie recommendation project.

All information you can find at my blog: http://datascienceb4b.blogspot.com/

For now I uploaded python scripts for creating database using Facebook, TMDb and Freebase APIs (fb_api.py, tmdb_api.py, freebase_api.py).
Also I uploaded script for web scraping (parser.py).
For connecting to MongoDb use db_connector.py script.

rate_movie.ipynb is ipython file for rating the movie (refer to Part 2 at my blog).
